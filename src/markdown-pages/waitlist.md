Hi there! Our mission at Edith Labs is to connect students with people who will invest in their future and help them succeed. As COVID-19 continues to impact universities around the world, we believe access to mentorship is more important than ever.

We posted about Edith on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6655666409177255936/) and received over 1500+ responses. We've also published a [blog post](https://edithlabs.com/introducing-edith/) about our launch if you'd like to read more.

In order to ensure the quality of interactions between students and mentors on the platform, we are going to bring students on the platform in batches. If you would like to join the waitlist, please submit your information below. We'd love to have you on the platform and look forward to having you on as soon as possible.
