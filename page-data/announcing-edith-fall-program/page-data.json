We have two goals with the ISA:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Help fund a student’s education by replacing their private loans<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup></li>\n<li>Connect the student with a group of mentors working in relevant fields that are invested in the student’s success</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you’re unclear about the distinction between public and private loans, we’ve written more <a href=\"https://edithlabs.com/what-are-student-loans/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">about it here</a>. </p>\n<p>For too long, the only outside funding option available to students was student loans. Loans are an inappropriate instrument to finance a student’s education because it <a href=\"https://edithlabs.com/what-are-student-loans/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">fundamentally misaligns incentives</a>. Banks do not create a relationship with the student and don’t care about a student’s long-term prospects. They just want to get repaid.</p>\n<p>We believe college students want more than access to money. College is a time of intense change for most students, and it can be extremely beneficial to have a mentor. Edith mentors partner with a student their junior year and stay with them through the first few years of their professional careers. This continuity, combined with the mentor’s experience, allows mentors to help students make and execute a plan.  </p>\n<p><strong>Application Deadline:</strong> Our applications close May 31st and we'll get back to you by June 8th. If you're already on the platform, you can find our application <a href=\"https://app.edithlabs.com/apply\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. You need an account to apply, so if you're not already on the platform but you're interested in our program reach out to us directly at nick@edithlabs.com.</p>\n<h2>Benefits of the Program</h2>\n<p>In addition to receiving funds through the ISA, there are two primary benefits for joining the cohort. </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Edith matches students with a lead mentor who is expected to check in on a bi-weekly basis, introduce the student to other mentors in their network, and is a student's main point of contact throughout the program. </li>\n<li>The program itself is a community. As more schools remain remote in the fall, Edith will host online events to help students get to know one another. Edith and the mentors will also host live AMAs, resume and career workshops, and guest speakers.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>How Edith's ISA Works</h2>\n<p>ISAs contain a few different terms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Payback Cap</strong> – students can repay up to 2.0x the amount borrowed.</li>\n<li><strong>Income Share</strong> – the percentage of salary per year that you’ll repay; we'll work individually with you to determine this percentage.</li>\n<li><strong>Term</strong> – Edith ISAs have a 5 year term (60 months).  </li>\n<li><strong>Minimum income threshold</strong> – Edith students only make payments towards their ISA if they make over $40,000 a year.</li>\n<li><strong>Grace period</strong> – if students are still searching for a job up to three months after graduation, they enter a grace period where they do not have to make payments and the ISA is not considered in deferment. </li>\n<li><strong>Deferment period</strong> – if a student remains below the minimum income threshold, their payments are delayed for up to 5 years. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>A sample ISA could look like this: a student receives $10,000 for their tuition in exchange for 3.0% of their salary over 5 years after graduation. If the student makes $85,000 a year in salary after graduation they would pay around $200 a month and $14,100 over the full 5 years. </p>\n<p>Before a student graduates, we would expect them to submit short weekly updates on any academic or professional progress. These updates are designed to help us help you, and we’ve found that having a weekly cadence is most effective for staying on track.  </p>\n<p>When a student receives/accepts their job offer, we’ll need a copy of their offer letter for income verification and legally will be required to be listed as recipients on the student’s tax return. </p>\n<p>After graduation, Edith Students will still have access to their lead mentors, as well as the broader group of mentors on the Edith platform. Our hope is that our Edith Students eventually make the transition to being Edith mentors.</p>\n<h2><strong>Common Questions</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>How is having a mentor any different than asking a question on Reddit or Quora? </strong></p>\n<p>In a world of information abundance on the internet, nothing beats real-world experience. We believe being to ask personal questions directly to someone working at your dream firm is an infinitely more useful experience than asking the broader internet. </p>\n<p>Additionally, unlike one-off questions over the internet, mentors on Edith partner with students over multiple years. Not only can they answer a student’s question at a given point in time, but mentors will also understand the long-term context of a student’s question and answer appropriately. We view the relationships between mentors and students as partnerships rather than one-off encounters. </p>\n<p><strong>What happens if I don’t get a job after graduation?</strong></p>\n<p>If a student cannot find a job immediately after graduation beyond the grace period, they enter a ‘deferment period.’ During this period the student doesn’t owe any payments and the term of their ISA is pushed back for the length of the deferment period. The maximum length of an ISA is 10 years, after which the student owes nothing regardless of payments made.<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup> If a student finds employment above the minimum income level within this 10 year period, their ISA would leave deferment and they would begin making payments. </p>\n<p><strong>If I get an extremely high paying job, did I just get screwed by signing up for this program?</strong></p>\n<p>This is exactly what the payback cap is for. We want everyone to be incentivized to shoot for the best possible outcome, and we want to make sure the student isn’t unduly harmed for succeeding. Students will never pay more than the agreed-upon payback cap, which is 2.0x the amount the student borrows. </p>\n<p><strong>If you are interested in applying to this program, please email us at <a href=\"mailto:apply@edithlabs.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">apply@edithlabs.com</a>.</strong></p>\n\n      <div class=\"footnotes\">\n        <hr/>\n        <ol >\n    \n    <li class=\"footnote-list-item\" id=\"fn-1\" >\n          \n        <p class=\"footnote-paragraph\" style=\"display:inline; \"><a href=\"https://edithlabs.com/what-are-student-loans/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">What are Student Loans</a></p>\n      <a href=\"#fnref-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\" style=\"display:inline;\">\n        ↩\n      </a>\n    \n      </li>\n      \n    \n\n    <li class=\"footnote-list-item\" id=\"fn-2\" >\n          \n        <p class=\"footnote-paragraph\" style=\"display:inline; \">Assuming the student acts in good faith with respect to the ISA</p>\n      <a href=\"#fnref-2\" class=\"footnote-backref\" style=\"display:inline;\">\n        ↩\n      </a>\n    \n      </li>\n      \n    </ol></div>","frontmatter":{"title":"Announcing Edith Fall '20 Program","date":"May 1, 2020","excerpt":"Why we’re funding students in the fall, how we’ll do it, and what it looks like for participating students.","definition":null,"author":"Nick Chua"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/announcing-edith-fall-program/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/how-to-be-an-effective-mentor-on-edith/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Effective Mentorship on Edith","type":"post","path":null}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/fireside-w-cem-koc-of-apple/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Fireside w/ Cem Koc of Apple","type":"post","path":null}}}}}
