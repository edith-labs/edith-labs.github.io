With tuition costs rising each year, it becomes harder and harder to make ends meet. Student loans are the main way to pay for higher education after exhausting financial aid, grants, and scholarships.</p>\n<p>There are generally four main components of a student loan:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lender:</strong> Typically the government or a bank, the lender is the one who gives money to pay for school. If the government is the lender, then it's a public student loan. If it's a bank, credit union, or online lender, it's a private student loan.</li>\n<li><strong>Principal:</strong> This is the amount you are borrowing. If you borrow $10,000 to pay for school, then the principal would be $10,000, and you would be paying that amount back plus interest.</li>\n<li><strong>Interest rate:</strong> This determine the additional amount you have to pay on top of paying back the principal. If you have a $10,000 loan with a 4% interest rate for one year, you would have to pay $400 as well as the $10,000 principal.</li>\n<li><strong>Term:</strong> The amount of time until you fully repay the principal. For student loans, this is typically 10 years.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<p>Let's say you take out a loan from the government with a principal of $10,000. The interest rate for a government loan issued between July 1, 2019, and July 1, 2020, is 4.53% with a term of 10 years. So what happens when you take out a student loan?</p>\n<p>You would make a monthly loan payment. Each loan payment has two components:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The amount of interest you owe each month as determined by your interest rate</li>\n<li>The amount you need to pay back each month so the principal is zero by the end of the loan term</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In this case, you would pay about $103 per month for 10 years. Since each payment reduces the principal owed, the amount of interest you pay also goes down with time. In the beginning of the loan payback, you'll be paying mostly interest. Near the end, you'll be mostly paying off the principal. As a result, more of your payment goes to paying off the principal as you make your payments.</p>\n<p>Over the life of the loan, you would pay $2,453.97 in interest. Let's look at how the first 4 payments break down in this example.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Month</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Principal</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Payment</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Principal Payment</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Interest Payment</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Jan 2020</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$10,000</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$103.78</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$66.03</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$37.75</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Feb 2020</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$9,933.97</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$103.78</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$66.28</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$37.50</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mar 2020</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$9,867.68</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$103.78</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$66.53</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$37.25</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Apr 2020</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$9,801.15</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$103.78</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$66.78</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$37.00</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>...</td>\n<td align=\"center\">...</td>\n<td align=\"center\">...</td>\n<td align=\"center\">...</td>\n<td align=\"center\">...</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Student loans are a way to fund your education if you've exhausted other means like financial aid, scholarship, and grants. However, if you fail to repay your loans, the interest continues to accumulate on the loan principal, leaving you hamstrung in debt.</p>\n<p>No matter how much money you make post-graduation, you need to make your loan payments. While loans are great for financing a home or a car when someone has a steady income, a student's outcome can be unpredictable.</p>\n<h2>Tell me more...</h2>\n<p><a href=\"#q1\">What is the difference between public and private student loans?</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"#q2\">Why would I ever have to take out private student loans?</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"#q3\">When do I start making my monthly loan payments?</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"#q4\">What is the difference between subsidized and unsubsidized student loans?</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"#q5\">When are income share agreements better than student loans?</a></p>\n<div className='anchor'><a name='q1'></a></div>\n<h3>What is the difference between public and private student loans?</h3>\n<p>Public student loans are issued by the government while private student loans are issued by banks, credit unions, and online lenders.</p>\n<p>Public student loans have standard terms defined by the government. For loans issued between July 1, 2019, and July 1, 2020, the interest rate is 4.53% with a term of 10 years.</p>\n<p>Private student loans differ depending on not just the lender but also your credit history (your record of paying off loans or credit card balances). This makes the process much less uniform, as you have to comparison shop across different lenders to find the best interest rate and terms. The additional hurdle of your credit history may also make it hard to get a favorable interest rate. If you don't have good credit or any credit history, you could see interest rates as high as 14%.</p>\n<p>The average private student loan has a 7.64% average fixed rate for 10-year private student loan. Let's compare how a $10,000 loan with these terms compares with the public student loan example from above.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Month</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Principal</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Payment</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Principal Payment</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Interest Payment</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Jan 2020</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$10,000</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$119.43</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$55.77</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$63.67</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Feb 2020</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$9,944.23</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$119.43</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$56.12</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$63.31</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mar 2020</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$9,888.11</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$119.43</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$56.48</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$62.95</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Apr 2020</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$9,831.63</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$119.43</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$56.84</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$62.59</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>...</td>\n<td align=\"center\">...</td>\n<td align=\"center\">...</td>\n<td align=\"center\">...</td>\n<td align=\"center\">...</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>While you only pay about $20.00 more per month because of the higher interest rate, more than half of the payment now goes towards interest rather than paying off the principal. In addition, if you end up in a situation where you have trouble making the monthly payment the lender will capitalize the interest which increases the principal amount.</p>\n<p>Compared to the $2,453.97 in interest you would pay with the public student loan, you would pay $4,332.05 (assuming you make all of your payments on time).</p>\n<div className='anchor'><a name='q2'></a></div>\n<h3>Why would I ever have to take out private student loans?</h3>\n<p>Because student loans are funded by the government, there is a maximum of public student loans you can take out.</p>\n<p>For dependent students (you still rely on financial support from a parent or guardian<sup id=\"fnref-5\"><a href=\"#fn-5\" class=\"footnote-ref\">5</a></sup>), the loan limit is $31,000.</p>\n<p>For independent students (you report your own income and taxes<sup id=\"fnref-5\"><a href=\"#fn-5\" class=\"footnote-ref\">5</a></sup>), the loan limit is $57,500.</p>\n<p>Even if you max out government loans, it is likely you will still have to find alternative funding sources. The average price of tuition at a private nonprofit four-year school in 2019 was $14,610 even after financial aid and other scholarship reduced the sticker price by $21,220<sup id=\"fnref-6\"><a href=\"#fn-6\" class=\"footnote-ref\">6</a></sup>. As a dependent student, you could have up to $25,000 of unmet financial need.</p>\n<p>Even though private student loans are generally much more costly than public student loans, they still make up a large chunk of student loan debt because there really aren't any other alternatives. Private student loan debt volume hit an estimated $13.1 billion<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup> in the 2018-2019 academic year, making up 11% of the student loans issued.</p>\n<div className='anchor'><a name='q3'></a></div>\n<h3>When do I start making my monthly loan payments?</h3>\n<p>Remember, the monthly loan payment serves two purposes: paying off the principal and paying off the interest. Generally, you immediately owe an interest payment on the loan the month following your loan issuance. Your principal payment can be deferred until you can afford to start paying off the principal. However, this means you will not reduce the principal so you would owe the same interest payment each month.</p>\n<p>For the $10,000 loan example above, you would owe a $63.97 the first month after your loan is issued. If you do not pay back any of the principal, you would continue to owe $63.97 each month, or it would be added to the principal, which is called capitalization of interest.</p>\n<p>There are specific types of public student loans where your interest payments are covered until you graduate plus a 6 month grace period. These are called subsidized student loans.</p>\n<p>For private student loans, some lenders offer deferred interest payments, but this is likely going to result in a higher interest payment.</p>\n<div className='anchor'><a name='q4'></a></div>\n<h3>What is the difference between subsidized and unsubsidized student loans?</h3>\n<p>There are two main types of public student loans, both with 10 year terms and 4.53% interest rates.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Direct Subsidized Loans</strong>: Government loans for students with <em>demonstrated financial need</em> where the interest payments are covered during school as well as during a 6 month grace period after graduation.</li>\n<li><strong>Direct Unsubsidized Loans</strong>: Government loans for any student but interest payments while in school are not covered.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The key difference between subsidized and unsubsidized loans is whether the government covers your interest payments during school. Referring to the first payment table in the example, you would need to pay $37.75 in interest payments every month for a $10,000 unsubsidized loan while you are in school - over 4 years of school, that would be about $1,800. Failure to make those payments would lead to a capitalization of interest, meaning the government would add the interest payments to your loan principal.</p>\n<p>Subsidized loans are thus much more advantageous than unsubsidized loans, as you don't make any payments until 6 months after you graduate school.</p>\n<p>Because the government funds these loans, there are maximums for the total amount of public loans you may take. There is an overall maximum of $23,000 in subsidized loans and an overall maximum of $31,000 in subsidized + unsubsidized loans. However, there is also a per year limit on public loans depending on the number of years you've been in school.</p>\n<p>As an independent student, your overall maximum for subsidized + unsubsidized loans is also higher at $57,500, but the subsidized loan maximum is the same at $23,000.</p>\n<p>For dependent students:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Year in School</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Subsidized Maximum</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Subsidized + Unsubsidized Maximum</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1st Year</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$3,500</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$5,500</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2nd Year</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$4,500</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$6,500</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd+ Year</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$5,500</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$7,500</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>For independent students:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Year in School</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Subsidized Maximum</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Subsidized + Unsubsidized Maximum</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1st Year</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$3,500</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$9,500</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2nd Year</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$4,500</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$1,0500</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd+ Year</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$5,500</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$1,2500</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Thus, if it takes you longer than 4 years to finish school, you will likely hit the maximum amount, regardless if you are just taking subsidized loans, or a combination of subsidized and unsubsidized loans. This means you have to find alternative sources for funding your education, which usually means private student loans.</p>\n<div className='anchor'><a name='q5'></a></div>\n<h3>When are income share agreements better than student loans?</h3>\n<p>Income share agreements have become an increasingly common alternative to student loans. If you haven't checked out our post <a href=\"/what-is-an-isa/\">What are Income Share Agreements?</a>, I recommend reading it before continuing to how ISAs compare with student loans.</p>\n<p>Letâ€™s revisit some of the numbers weâ€™ve discussed earlier. A private 4-year institution has a per year cost of $14,610. Even with maxing out subsidized and unsubsidized government loans each year for a total of $27,000, you would still have about $29,000 of unmet need. To make things easier math-wise, let's say you received a more generous aid package and have $20,000 of unmet need.</p>\n<p>We can compare how a private student loan with a 10 year term and 7.64% interest rate stacks up against an equivalent ISA. Assuming a yearly income of $50,000 post-graduation, we'll use a 10 year, 4.5% ISA. This means you would pay 4.5% of your income for 10 years. However, the ISAs we issue will generally be shorter term (between 5-7 years).</p>\n<p>These would be the approximate yearly loan and ISA payments.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Year</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Salary</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Loan Payment</th>\n<th align=\"center\">ISA Payment</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>2020</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$50,000</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$2,866</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$2,250</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2021</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$52,500</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$2,866</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$2,363</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2022</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$55,125</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$2,866</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$2,481</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2023</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$57,881</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$2,866</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$2,605</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2024</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$60,775</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$2,866</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$2,735</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2025</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$63,814</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$2,866</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$2,872</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2026</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$67,005</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$2,866</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$3,015</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2027</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$70,355</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$2,866</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$3,166</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2028</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$73,873</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$2,866</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$3,324</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2029</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$77,566</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$2,866</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$3,490</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Over the life of the ISA, you would pay $28,300 compared to $28,664 for the private student loan.</p>\n<p>From a purely financial sense, ISAs make sense. You will owe a similar amount or less than you would with private student loans.</p>\n<p>You only pay more if you make more (which we believe a partnership with a mentor and the aligned incentives of an ISA help increase your earnings potential).</p>\n<p>The true power of ISAs is not as a replacement to debt, but rather as a tool to create a team with a mentor. We believe mentors provide value through their network, career advice, and recruiting help, which will ultimately lead to better career outcomes for the student.</p>\n<p>If there was no mentor involved and you were merely using the ISA as a replacement for debt, it would almost be a bet against yourself. Itâ€™s giving up some of the upside of your earnings potential in exchange for downside financial protection in the case that you fail - you pay much less or nothing if you have a low income.</p>\n<p>However, we believe that given the necessary financial support and mentorship, all students have a lot of unrealized talent. We want ISAs to be a bet on yourself - that you will succeed more than society expects you to.</p>\n<p>Weâ€™re not building Edith to provide an alternative to debt. Weâ€™re building Edith to provide the next generation of students the mentorship and support they need to have successful and fulfilling careers. The consequence of that is we are building a system that disrupts private and eventually public student loans for the better.</p>\n\n      <div class=\"footnotes\">\n        <hr/>\n        <ol >\n    \n    <li class=\"footnote-list-item\" id=\"fn-1\" >\n          \n        <p class=\"footnote-paragraph\" style=\"display:inline; \"><a href=\"https://research.collegeboard.org/trends/student-aid/figures-tables/total-federal-and-nonfederal-loans-type-over-time\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Total federal and nonfederal loans by type over time</a></p>\n      <a href=\"#fnref-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\" style=\"display:inline;\">\n        â†©\n      </a>\n    \n      </li>\n      \n    \n\n    <li class=\"footnote-list-item\" id=\"fn-2\" >\n          \n        <p class=\"footnote-paragraph\" style=\"display:inline; \"><a href=\"https://studentloanhero.com/student-loan-debt-statistics/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">A Look at the Shocking Student Loan Debt Statistics for 2020</a></p>\n      <a href=\"#fnref-2\" class=\"footnote-backref\" style=\"display:inline;\">\n        â†©\n      </a>\n    \n      </li>\n      \n    \n\n    <li class=\"footnote-list-item\" id=\"fn-3\" >\n          \n        <p class=\"footnote-paragraph\" style=\"display:inline; \"><a href=\"https://www.thebalance.com/average-student-loan-interest-rate-4684306\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">What Is the Average Student Loan Interest Rate?</a></p>\n      <a href=\"#fnref-3\" class=\"footnote-backref\" style=\"display:inline;\">\n        â†©\n      </a>\n    \n      </li>\n      \n    \n\n    <li class=\"footnote-list-item\" id=\"fn-4\" >\n          \n        <p class=\"footnote-paragraph\" style=\"display:inline; \"><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/loans/student-loans/student-loan-debt/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">2019 Student Loan Debt Statistics</a></p>\n      <a href=\"#fnref-4\" class=\"footnote-backref\" style=\"display:inline;\">\n        â†©\n      </a>\n    \n      </li>\n      \n    \n\n    <li class=\"footnote-list-item\" id=\"fn-5\" >\n          \n        <p class=\"footnote-paragraph\" style=\"display:inline; \"><a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/apply-for-aid/fafsa/filling-out/dependency#dependent-or-independent\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">For purposes of applying for federal student aid, whatâ€™s the difference between a dependent student and an independent student?</a></p>\n      <a href=\"#fnref-5\" class=\"footnote-backref\" style=\"display:inline;\">\n        â†©\n      </a>\n    \n      </li>\n      \n    \n\n    <li class=\"footnote-list-item\" id=\"fn-6\" >\n          \n        <p class=\"footnote-paragraph\" style=\"display:inline; \"><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/17/the-10-private-us-colleges-that-pay-off-the-most.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">The 10 private US colleges that pay off the most</a></p>\n      <a href=\"#fnref-6\" class=\"footnote-backref\" style=\"display:inline;\">\n        â†©\n      </a>\n    \n      </li>\n      \n    </ol></div>","frontmatter":{"title":"What are Student Loans?","date":"March 10, 2020","excerpt":"How do you pay for school when you exhaust financial aid, scholarships, and grants?
