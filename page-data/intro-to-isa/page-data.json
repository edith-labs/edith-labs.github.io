If the ISA is $15,000 for 5% of their salary for 5 years after graduation, their payments would look like this. </p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Year</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Salary</th>\n<th align=\"center\">ISA Payment</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>2021</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$70,000</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$3,500</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2022</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$73,500</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$3,675</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2023</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$77,125</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$3,859</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2024</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$81,031</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$4,052</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2025</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$85,085</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$4,254</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Why are they better than traditional loans?</h3>\n<p>With traditional loans, the lender has no incentive to help the borrower. If a borrower is unable to repay the loan, lenders can typically collect the borrower’s assets (their collateral) in order to recoup their loan. Lenders make most of their money off of interest, which actually increases if the borrower is unable to pay on time. Therefore, lenders have every incentive to see the borrower fail to pay off their loans on time. The interest will grow, and they can collect the borrower’s collateral if they can’t afford the interest.</p>\n<p>With an ISA on Edith, mentors actually want to see the borrowers succeed. There are no interest payments tied to the principal, so the mentor only gets paid if the borrower does. Typically, the ISA includes a minimum salary as well - if the borrower makes less than the minimum, they pay nothing until they make more. Because the borrower is only paying a percentage of their income, they can never be overburdened. </p>\n<h3>Are there any historical precedents for ISAs?</h3>\n<p>Milton Friedman was the first to propose human equity investments in his 1955 paper The Role of Government in Education<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>. In his paper, he argues that investing in human beings cannot be financed using debt because they are fundamentally different than physical capital. The productivity of physical capital (like a machine, or a car) is pretty fixed, but the productivity of human beings is highly variable. On one hand, people can be hampered by sickness or physical incapacitation, but on the other people can get extremely lucky. This makes it really hard to set interest rates for humans.</p>\n<p>Therefore, fixed money loans (like student debt currently) secured by expected future earnings must set a sufficiently high nominal interest rate on all loans. They have to set high rates because some students will fail to repay their loans, so the rates for successful students must be sufficiently high enough to subsidize their failure to repay. This is why all students are charged high interest rates on student debt regardless of ability, school, or major. </p>\n<p>Instead of taking on debt, Friedman proposed that investors could purchase a share of an individual’s earning prospects. This allows for variable pricing for students based on ability and expected earnings.</p>\n<p>Yale attempted a modified version of Friedman’s proposal in the 1970s<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup>. However, instead of repaying a portion of their income for a specified number of years, all participants were required to repay a portion of their income until the entire group’s balance was repaid. This experiment ended in failure because successful programs felt like they had to pay more than their fair share as they subsidized others who were unsuccessful or refused to pay. It took decades before another school gave ISAs a chance.</p>\n<h3>What ISA Programs Exist Today?</h3>\n<p>In 2016, Purdue launched their ‘Back a Boiler’ ISA program. Because Federal loans are offered at low interest rates, Purdue’s program aims to replace the more expensive private and PLUS loans<sup id=\"fnref-3\"><a href=\"#fn-3\" class=\"footnote-ref\">3</a></sup>. The program is available to sophomores, juniors, and seniors of any major. The pricing of each student’s ISA depends on their expected income, which is calculated through a mix of their year and major. It does not take into account individual ability. </p>\n<p>Lambda School is another educational institution launched in 2016 which utilizes ISAs. Lambda is a nine month coding boot camp where students pay nothing until they find a tech job that pays more than $50,000 annually. Once employed, students pay 17% of their income for 24 months or until they pay $30,000. Lambda School is the first example of using ISAs to align incentives with students because they only get paid when their students do.</p>\n<p>Edith is taking both of these approaches to the next level. Students on Edith are paired with mentors who both have had relevant work experience and are willing to finance the student’s education. Each ISA is personalized based on the student’s background, and mentors are financially incentivized to help their student succeed. Unlike Yale’s program, each mentor will only have a few students and each student will have an individual ISA, so students don’t have to worry about subsidizing others. </p>\n<h2>What are some concerns regarding ISAs?</h2>\n<h3>Adverse Selection</h3>\n<p>Because students only pay when they make money, there are some concerns that only unsuccessful students would want to take on an ISA. </p>\n<p>Kevin Mumford, an associate professor of economics at Purdue University, wanted to test these concerns. He studied 431 students that decided to participate in the Back a Boiler program at Purdue and 319 students that were selected to participate but chose not to. He found no evidence of adverse selection amongst these students. In fact, students who chose to participate on average had higher prior-year GPAs than those who chose not to participate<sup id=\"fnref-4\"><a href=\"#fn-4\" class=\"footnote-ref\">4</a></sup>.</p>\n\n      <div class=\"footnotes\">\n        <hr/>\n        <ol >\n    \n    <li class=\"footnote-list-item\" id=\"fn-1\" >\n          \n        <p class=\"footnote-paragraph\" style=\"display:inline; \"><a href=\"http://la.utexas.edu/users/hcleaver/330T/350kPEEFriedmanRoleOfGovttable.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Role of Government in Education, Milton Friedman 1955</a></p>\n      <a href=\"#fnref-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\" style=\"display:inline;\">\n        ↩\n      </a>\n    \n      </li>\n      \n    \n\n    <li class=\"footnote-list-item\" id=\"fn-2\" >\n          \n        <p class=\"footnote-paragraph\" style=\"display:inline; \"><a href=\"https://incomeshareagreements.org/income-share-agreements-isas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yale’s ISA Experiment</a></p>\n      <a href=\"#fnref-2\" class=\"footnote-backref\" style=\"display:inline;\">\n        ↩\n      </a>\n    \n      </li>\n      \n    \n\n    <li class=\"footnote-list-item\" id=\"fn-3\" >\n          \n        <p class=\"footnote-paragraph\" style=\"display:inline; \"><a href=\"https://www.purdue.edu/backaboiler/FAQ/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">FAQ on Purdue’s ISA Program</a></p>\n      <a href=\"#fnref-3\" class=\"footnote-backref\" style=\"display:inline;\">\n        ↩\n      </a>\n    \n      </li>\n      \n    </ol></div>\n<p>[^4[: [Kevin Mumford, Student Selection into an Income Share Agreement, 2018]{<a href=\"https://krannert.purdue.edu/faculty/kjmumfor/papers/Mumford%20Income%20Share%20Agreement%20Selection.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://krannert.purdue.edu/faculty/kjmumfor/papers/Mumford%20Income%20Share%20Agreement%20Selection.pdf</a>)</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Intro to Income Share Agreements","date":"February 24, 2020","excerpt":"Learn about the history of ISAs, how they can be applied to student debt, and how Edith can help you"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/intro-to-isa/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/student-debt/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Financing Education in Today's World"}}}}}
