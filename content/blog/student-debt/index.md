excerpt: 'How student loans work today and why (and when) income share agreements make sense.'
---

Paying for school is hard. With a mix of public student loans, private student loans, grants, and financial aid, there is a lot of information to navigate and a lot of hoops to jump through to determine just how much help you need, and how much help these services will give you.

The genesis of Edith came from the importance of investing in the future and in doing so investing in people. But before we get there, it’s important to understand where we are now and how Edith’s solution fits into this ecosystem. This post will highlight the various types of student loans and their mechanics. The information presented is nowhere near comprehensive, but should give you a good idea of the costs of student loans.

We’ll then transition to income share agreements (ISAs) and why (and when) they make sense financially compared to student loans. If you haven’t read our primer on ISAs, you can find it here. We’ll conclude with why income and why we at Edith believe that income share agreements are more than just an alternative to debt, but a way to make a bet on yourself.

# Public Student Loans

Public student loans are the foundation of the existing system. The government is the main lender in this case, providing favorable rates to help students pay for their education.
* **Direct Subsidized Loans**: loans from the government for students with demonstrated financial need where the interest payments are covered during school as well as during a 6 month grace period after graduation
* **Direct Unsubsidized Loans**: loans from the government for students, but interest payments while in school are not covered

We’ll be focusing specifically on direct subsidized loans, and at any point where I reference public student loans, I am referring to that. Because these loans are subsidized by the government there are specific loan limits. There is an overall maximum of $23,000 in subsidized loans, but also there is a limit for each year.
* Subsidized maximum
    * 1st year: $3500
    * 2nd year: $4500
    * 3rd year+: $5500
Thus, if it takes you longer than 4 years to finish school, you will likely hit the maximum amount and have to find alternative sources for funding your education like direct unsubsidized loans or private student loans.

Public student loans have a 4.53% interest rate for loans issued after July 1, 2019, and before July 1, 2020.

Another important note: the average net price of tuition and fees in 2019 is $14,610 at private nonprofit four-year schools. Financial aid and other scholarships reduce the sticker price off these school by about $21,220.

But clearly, the math doesn’t add up. With an average cost of $14,610 after aid, there is still about $10,000 of need to be met after subsidized student loans.

# Private Student Loans

After both subsidized and unsubsidized student loans, private student loans issued by banks, credit unions or online lenders are really the only alternative.

Private student loan debt volume hit an estimated $13.1 billion[^1] in the 2018-2019 academic year.

Depending on the type of the loan, payments can either be deferred, interest only, a monthly fee, or you can start paying interest and principal while you are in school.

The average private student loan has a 7.64% average fixed rate for 10-year private student loan.

# How ISAs Disrupt Student Loans

Let’s revisit some of the numbers we’ve discussed earlier. A private 4-year institution has a per year cost of $14,610.  Let’s max out government subsidized loans at 3500 + 4500  + 5500 + 5500 and 8000 in unsubsidized loans, that leaves us with about 29000 of unmet need which we’ll round to 25000 to make it easier.

Let’s consider a situation w

From a purely financial sense, ISAs make clear sense. You will owe a similar amount or less than you would with private student loans, you only pay more, if you make more (which we believe a partnership with a mentor and the aligned incentives of an ISA help increase your earnings potential).

ISAs as an alternative to student debt is a bet against yourself. It’s giving up some of the upside of your earnings potential in exchange for downside financial protection in the case that you fail - you pay much less or nothing if you have a low income.

However, we believe that given the necessary financial support and mentorship, all students have a lot of unrealized talent. We want ISAs to be a bet on yourself - that you will succeed more than society expects you to.

We’re not building Edith to provide an alternative to debt. We’re building Edith to provide the next generation of students the mentorship and support they need to have successful and fulfilling careers. The consequence of that is we are building a system that disrupts private and eventually public student loans for the better.
