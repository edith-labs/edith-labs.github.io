excerpt: 'How student loans work today and why (and when) income share agreements make sense.'
---

Paying for school is hard. With a mix of public student loans, private student loans, grants, and financial aid, there is a lot of information to navigate and a lot of hoops to jump through to determine just how much help you need, and how much help these services will give you.

The genesis of Edith came from the importance of investing in the future and in doing so investing in people. But before we get there, it’s important to understand where we are now and how Edith’s solution fits into this ecosystem. This post will highlight the various types of student loans and their mechanics. The information presented is nowhere near comprehensive, but should give you a good idea of the costs of student loans.

We’ll then transition to income share agreements (ISAs) and why (and when) they make sense financially compared to student loans. If you haven’t read our primer on ISAs, you can find it here. We’ll conclude with why income and why we at Edith believe that income share agreements are more than just an alternative to debt, but a way to make a bet on yourself.

# Public Student Loans

Public student loans are the foundation of the existing system of student financing, making up $106.2 billion of the $119.3 billion in loans issued during the 2018-2019 school year[^1]. In the case of public student loans, the government gives you money to pay for school and/or living expenses and you pay back the loan over 10 years with a generally favorable interest rate set by the government. For loans issued between July 1, 2019, and July 1, 2020, the interest rate is a fixed 4.53%.

For example, for a $10,000 loan from the government, you would pay about $103 per month for 10 years. From each payment, part of it pays back the $10,000 (which is generally referred to as the principal) and part of it pays the interest on the loan. Over time as you make the payments, the principal goes down, so the amount of interest you pay goes down. As a result, more of your payment goes to paying off the principal as you make your payments.

Over the life of the loan, you would pay $2,453.97 in interest. Let's look at how the first 4 payments break down in this example.

| Month         | Principal     | Payment   | Principal Payment | Interest Payment |
| ------------- |:-------------:|:---------:|:-----------------:|:----------------:|
| Jan 2020      | $10,000       | $103.78   |       $66.03	    |     $37.75       |
| Feb 2020      | $9,933.97     | $103.78   |       $66.28	    |     $37.50       |
| Mar 2020      | $9,867.68     | $103.78   |       $66.53	    |     $37.25	   |
| Apr 2020      | $9,801.15     | $103.78   |       $66.78	    |     $37.00	   |
| ...           | ...           |   ...     |       ...         |       ...        |


There are two main types of public student loans, both with 10 year terms and 4.53% interest rates.

* **Direct Subsidized Loans**: Government loans for students with *demonstrated financial need* where the interest payments are covered during school as well as during a 6 month grace period after graduation.
* **Direct Unsubsidized Loans**: Government loans for students not necessarily with financial need, but interest payments while in school are not covered.

The key difference between subsidized and unsubsidized loans is whether the government covers your interest payments during school. Referring to the payment table above, you would need to pay $37.75 in interest payments every month for a $10,000 unsubsidized loan while you are in school - over 4 years of school, that would be about $1,800. Failure to make those payments would lead to a capitalization of interest, meaning the government would add the interest payments to your loan principal.

Subsidized loans are thus much more advantageous than unsubsidized loans, as you don't make any payments until 6 months after you graduate school.

Because the government funds these loans, there are maximums for the total amount of public loans you may take. There is an overall maximum of $23,000 in subsidized loans and an overall maximum of $31,000 in subsidized + unsubsidized loans. However, there is also a per year limit on public loans depending on the number of years you've been in school.

For dependent students (you still rely on financial support from a parent or guardian[^5]):

| Year in School | Subsidized Maximum | Subsidized + Unsubsidized Maximum |
| -------------- |:------------------:|:---------------------------------:|
| 1st Year       | $3,500             | $5,500                            |
| 2nd Year       | $4,500             | $6,500                            |
| 3rd+ Year      | $5,500             | $7,500                            |

For independent students (you report your own income and taxes[^5]):

| Year in School | Subsidized Maximum | Subsidized + Unsubsidized Maximum |
| -------------- |:------------------:|:---------------------------------:|
| 1st Year       | $3,500             | $9,500                            |
| 2nd Year       | $4,500             | $1,0500                           |
| 3rd+ Year      | $5,500             | $1,2500                           |

As an independent student, your overall maximum for subsidized + unsubsidized loans is also higher at $57,500.

Thus, if it takes you longer than 4 years to finish school, you will likely hit the maximum amount, regardless if you are just taking subsidized loans, or a combination of subsidized and unsubsidized loans. This means you have to find alternative sources for funding your education, which usually means private student loans.

Even if you max out government loans, it is likely you will still have to find alternative funding sources. At private nonprofit four-year schools, the average net price of tuition and fees in 2019 was $14,610 after financial aid and other scholarships reduce the sticker price off these schools by about $21,220[^6].

After subsidized and unsubsidized student loans, there is still about $10,000 of need to be met as a dependent student.

# Private Student Loans

Traditionally, private student loans fill the gap between public loans and the cost of tuition. Private student loans have the same mechanics as public student loans, with a principal amount borrowed, an interest rate, and monthly payments to pay back the loan.

However, instead of borrowing money from the government, banks, credit unions, or online lenders lend money for private student loans. This makes the process much less uniform, as you have to comparison shop across different lenders to find the best interest rate and terms. There is also an additional hurdle of your credit history determining your interest rate. If you don't have good credit or any credit history, you could see interest rates as high as 14%.

The average private student loan has a 7.64% average fixed rate for 10-year private student loan. Let's compare how a $10,000 loan with these terms compares with the public student loan example from above.

| Month         | Principal     | Payment   | Principal Payment | Interest Payment |
| ------------- |:-------------:|:---------:|:-----------------:|:----------------:|
| Jan 2020      | $10,000       | $119.43   |       $55.77	    |     $63.67       |
| Feb 2020      | $9,944.23     | $119.43   |       $56.12	    |     $63.31       |
| Mar 2020      | $9,888.11     | $119.43   |       $56.48	    |     $62.95	   |
| Apr 2020      | $9,831.63     | $119.43   |       $56.84	    |     $62.59	   |
| ...           | ...           |   ...     |       ...         |       ...        |

While you only pay about $20.00 more per month, because of the higher interest rate, more than half of the payment now goes towards interest rather than paying off the principal. In addition, if you end up in a situation where you have trouble making the monthly payment, the lender will capitalize the interest which increases the principal amount.

Compared to the $2,453.97 in interest you would pay with the public student loan, you would pay $4,332.05 (assuming you make all of your payments on time).

Even though private student loans are generally much more costly than public student loans, they still make up a large chunk of student loan debt because there really aren't any other alternatives. Private student loan debt volume hit an estimated $13.1 billion[^1] in the 2018-2019 academic year, making up 11% of the student loans issued.

# How ISAs Disrupt Student Loans

Income share agreements have become an increasingly common alternative to student loans. If you haven't checked out our [Income Share Agreement FAQ](/income-share-agreements/), I recommend reading it before continuing to how ISAs compare to student loans.

Let’s revisit some of the numbers we’ve discussed earlier. A private 4-year institution has a per year cost of $14,610. Even with maxing out subsidized and unsubsidized government loans each year for a total of $27,000, you would still have about $29,000 of unmet need. To make things easier math-wise, let's say you received a more generous aid package and have $20,000 of unmet need.

We can compare how a private student loan with a 10 year term and 7.64% interest rate stacks up against an equivalent ISA. Assuming a yearly income of $50,000 post-graduation, we'll use a 10 year, 4.5% ISA. This means you would pay 4.5% of your income for 10 years. However, the ISAs we issue will generally be shorter term (between 5-7 years).

These would be the approximate yearly loan and ISA payments.

| Year | Salary             | Loan Payment | ISA Payment |
| ---- |:------------------:|:------------:|:-----------:|
| 2020 | $50,000            | $2,866       | $2,250      |
| 2021 | $52,500            | $2,866       | $2,363      |
| 2022 | $55,125            | $2,866       | $2,481      |
| 2023 | $57,881            | $2,866       | $2,605      |
| 2024 | $60,775            | $2,866       | $2,735      |
| 2025 | $63,814            | $2,866       | $2,872      |
| 2026 | $67,005            | $2,866       | $3,015      |
| 2027 | $70,355            | $2,866       | $3,166      |
| 2028 | $73,873            | $2,866       | $3,324      |
| 2029 | $77,566            | $2,866       | $3,490      |

Over the life of the ISA, you would pay $28,300 compared to $28,664 for the private student loan.

From a purely financial sense, ISAs make sense. You will owe a similar amount or less than you would with private student loans.

You only pay more, if you make more (which we believe a partnership with a mentor and the aligned incentives of an ISA help increase your earnings potential).

ISAs as an alternative to student debt is a bet against yourself. It’s giving up some of the upside of your earnings potential in exchange for downside financial protection in the case that you fail - you pay much less or nothing if you have a low income.

However, we believe that given the necessary financial support and mentorship, all students have a lot of unrealized talent. We want ISAs to be a bet on yourself - that you will succeed more than society expects you to.

We’re not building Edith to provide an alternative to debt. We’re building Edith to provide the next generation of students the mentorship and support they need to have successful and fulfilling careers. The consequence of that is we are building a system that disrupts private and eventually public student loans for the better.
